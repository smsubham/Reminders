# Reminders
First Android project using Learn.Android.Studio.Build.Android.Apps.Quickly.and.Effectively by Adam Gerber
The core functionality will allow you to create and delete
reminders and flag certain reminders as important. An important item will be emphasized by
an orange tab to the left of the reminderâ€™s text. The app will incorporate an action bar menu,
context menus, a local database for persistence, and multiple selection on devices that
support multiple selection.
